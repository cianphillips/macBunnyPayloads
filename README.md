# macBunnyPayloads
I am most interested in the Mac payloads and wanted to create an easy way to have all the mac scripts in one folder without too much maintenaince or bother. One-liner to make a Mac folder of symbolic links in the BashBunny/payloads/library directory pointing to every payload that has the letters mac in it.
